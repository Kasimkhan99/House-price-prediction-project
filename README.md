# House-price-prediction-project
🏡 House Price Prediction  This project is a machine learning web application that predicts house prices based on input features such as the number of rooms, area, location, and other property details. It helps users estimate property prices more accurately using data-driven insights.

🔹 Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for training.

Model Training: Implemented regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict house prices.

Evaluation: Compared models using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R² score.

Web App: Built an interactive UI using Streamlit for real-time price prediction.

Database Integration: Used MongoDB to store predictions and user interactions.

🔹 Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Joblib)

Streamlit (frontend for predictions)

MongoDB (database for storing results)

🔹 How It Works

User enters property details (area, location, number of bedrooms, etc.).

The trained model predicts the estimated house price.

Prediction is displayed instantly on the web app.

All predictions can be stored in MongoDB for future analysis.

🔹 Future Improvements

Add advanced models (XGBoost, CatBoost, Neural Networks).

Improve accuracy with feature engineering.

Deploy the app on Heroku / AWS / Render.

Add visual analytics dashboard.
